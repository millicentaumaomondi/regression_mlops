 #Demo
ðŸ‘‰ [Try the deployed app on Hugging Face:]
(https://huggingface.co/spaces/momondi/regression_mlops)

 ML Pipeline (ZenML)
Ingestion: Load dataset

Cleaning: Handle missing values, feature selection

Training: Train LinearRegression model

Evaluation: Calculate MSE and RÂ² score

Deployment: Package and upload model for use in app

# Model Info
Algorithm: LinearRegression (sklearn)

Metrics:

âœ… Mean Squared Error (MSE)

âœ… RÂ² Score

# How to Run Locally
# Step 1: Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/millicentaumaomondi/regression_mlops.git
cd regression_mlops

# Step 2: Create environment and install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 3: Launch the app
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
